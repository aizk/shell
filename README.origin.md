# st
Shell tools.

## Environment

Tested on CentOS7 only for now.

## usage

Run:

```bash
. <(curl st.wolfogre.com)
```

You will get a command named `st` on your linux session, and you can do many things with st, run `st help` to see them.

For example, run `st count-conn 80` and see how many tcp connections in you port 80, and what the remote ip addresses are.

New tools will be added one by one.

## uninstall

Close you session and `st` disappear without anything left.

## st help
